# PLUS_Software_Dev_ClimateDataProject
The project provides functionality to query and analyze current and historical weather data from the meteostat python library.
It also provides examples of visualisations, along with functions to create these visualisations.

### `ClimateChangeLocalScale.ipynb`:
Analyzes local climate change by comparing recent temperature data with historical climate normals, using data from the nearest weather stations to specified geographic coordinates
### `isabellatk_climate_v3.ipynb`:
Demo file for accessing and analyzing data from meteostat. Further provides templates for generating various charts like temperature trends, wind speed distributions, and precipitation patterns for specific locations and time frames.
### directory `code`:
Contains a demo notebook `bbox_querying_helper.ipynb` and the main file `bbox_querying_functions.py`. The notebook demonstrates how to use various functions, provided in the .py file, for querying and analyzing meteorological stations within a defined geographic bounding box, including retrieving station data, identifying the station with the longest data record, finding consensus periods, and determining the most representative station based on specific weather data.
### `Vincent_FurtherVisualization.ipynb` \& `A3_Vica.ipynb`:
Involve installing libraries, fetching and visualizing weather data for Salzburg using various tools including Meteostat, Seaborn, and Plotly, though both encounter issues with data visualization and installation paths.
