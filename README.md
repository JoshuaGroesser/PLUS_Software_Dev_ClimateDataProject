# PLUS_Software_Dev_ClimateDataProject
Here we can work on our software project

Let us start with a brainstorming of what might be possible/cool/interesting/... Feel free to add whatever you want:
- Use meteostat to import climate/weather data to python (https://github.com/meteostat/meteostat-python)
- visualize weather data in a map/time series plot
- take a look into geopanda and folium
- qgis plugin
- simple weather forecast
- compare different places
- compare different times for one place
- visualize climate change on a map/time series plot
- compare monthly/seasonal data
- gui (?)
